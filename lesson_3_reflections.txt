When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repo (such as one hosted on a service like Github) is useful for keep store of your projects online, so that you can access the project files on a different machine, anywhere in the world. It is also useful to use a remote repo when collaborating so team members have a central place to push and pull changes to a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pulling of changes allows for predictable working environment. When working on a project, if new changes to a remote repo were automatically pulled to local, you could have unforeseen changes reflected in a portion of a project that you are working on. This could lead to confusing and unpredictable results.
